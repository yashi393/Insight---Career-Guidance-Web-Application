**Insight – Career Guidance Web Application**

Insight is a web-based Career Guidance platform designed to help students and early professionals understand the vast opportunities available in today’s technology-driven world. Many individuals struggle to choose the right career path due to a lack of awareness about domains, required skills, job roles, and growth trends. Insight aims to solve this problem by offering personalized tests, detailed domain information, and instant guidance — all in one place.

🚀 Features
1. Career Assessment Tests

Insight provides three different tests to help users understand their strengths and interests:

• Aptitude Test: Evaluates basic logical reasoning, problem-solving skills, and general aptitude to identify suitable career directions.

• Domain Test: Assesses user preferences and interest areas across various tech domains to recommend relevant fields.

👥 Project Background

This project was originally part of an academic group assignment. However, the initial version lacked integration and a proper interface.
To improve the project’s quality, performance, and usability, I rebuilt the entire application individually from scratch, including:

-- Redesigned UI

-- Integrated backend

-- Rebuilt database structure

-- Implemented test logic and domain info modules

-- Deployed the web app independently
